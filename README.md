# VaniConnect: Sign Language to Voice Transcriber


## 📌 Introduction
VaniConnect is an innovative solution designed to bridge communication gaps between individuals who use sign language and those who do not understand it proficiently. It translates real-time sign language gestures into spoken language using **computer vision and machine learning**.

## 🎯 Features
- 📹 **Real-time Gesture Recognition** using OpenCV and Deep Learning.
- 🎤 **Text-to-Speech Conversion** for seamless communication.
- 💻 **User-friendly GUI** with an interactive display of gestures and translations.
- 🌍 **Promotes Accessibility & Inclusivity** for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
### **Software Requirements:**
- **Computer Vision & Image Processing:** OpenCV, Mediapipe, Pillow
- **Numerical Computing:** NumPy
- **Text-to-Speech:** Pyttsx3
- **GUI Development:** Tkinter
- **Development Environment:** IDLE

### **Hardware Requirements:**
- Camera or Sensor System
- Processing Unit
- Microphones and Audio Equipment
- Display and Output Devices

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Captures video input** of sign language gestures.
2. **Processes frames** using OpenCV and extracts hand gestures.
3. **Recognizes gestures** with a deep learning model.
4. **Converts recognized gestures** into corresponding text.
5. **Text-to-speech (TTS)** converts the text into spoken language.
